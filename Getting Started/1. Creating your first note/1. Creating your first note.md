Welcome to Collate!

To start taking notes with Collate, Click the + Markdown button in the top bar. This will create a Markdown note where you can enter text using [Github Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

You can also take notes using the other Note Types as well by clicking the dropdown arrow and choosing the note type. This will select the note type and allow you to create a new note of that type. Collate currently has four different note types:

1. Markdown
	- A text editor utilizing Markdown formatting.
2. Rich Text
	- A WYSIWYG editor that hides the text formatting. Files are saved as HTML and can be viewed in a browser.
3. Outline
	- Create an infinitely nested outline that doubles as a checklist.
4. Web Clipper
	- Save a copy of a website locally for future use.
